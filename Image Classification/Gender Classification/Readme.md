Here I have tried to classify a set of images as male and female. I have tried several approaches which I learnt and noted the experience 
here. I have also tried to track down certain tuning to Hyperparameters and thier results.


1. **Male_Female.ipynb** Keras and Tensorflow was used with 3-4 hidden layers in CNN and tried to compare results. Apart from one case        where there was only 1 hidden layer,all other models were showing accuracy around 72-76%.

2. **Gender_Classification_FastAI.ipynb** In another attempt I tried to train my model with already trained Resnet32 and Resnet50 with help    of FastAI. Resnet50 gave pretty accurate result with error rate of only 7%.
